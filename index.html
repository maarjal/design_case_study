        <h3>1. The Overview</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://untranslatables.herokuapp.com/">Untranslatables</a> is a web app that presents The Book of Life's "Untranslatable Words" in an entertaining, edyfying and aesthetically pleasing way.

        <h3>2. The Context and Challenge</h3>
        <p><em><a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/untranslatable-words/">The Book of Life</em></a> explains Untranslatable Words as moods, needs and feelings that our own language has not yet properly pinned down. The perfect word – even if it comes from abroad – can help us to explain ourselves to other people – and its existence quietly reassures us (and everyone else) that a state of mind is not really rare, just rarely spoken of. The right word brings dignity to our troubles, and helps us identify more accurately what we really like or find annoying.</p>

        <p>The challenge is create subtle and simple design that would unify the words with many different origins and meanings.</p>

        <h3>3. The Process and Insight</h3>
        <p>We wanted to persent each word with an illustration (like in the book). First we considered stock photos, but finding unified photos that would add to the overall design look was a challenge.</p>
        <p>We wanted to create a simple and clean layout, where each word would have a center focus on the page. We decided to create a card for each word, with a background image and a description in addition to the word itself.</p>
        <p>We were inspired by the websites that would be content specific, yet simple and slightly "addictive", like <a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com/">this one.</a>We decided to look into CSS transforms and animations to give some life to the scrollable web page.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>4. The Solution</h3>
        <p>We decided to present each word on a piece of fine art background. The fine art background creates a unified look for words with a wide range of meanings, as well as adds a fresh look for the meaning.</p>
        <p>On hover CSS transforms add subtle playfullness to the reading experience</p>
        <p>The background color animation creates a feeling of "new theme", when scrolling down for a new card.</p>

        <h3>5. Results</h3>
        <p><em>"The CSS transformations are really calming"</em></p>
        <p><em>"I like the scrolling effect. Is this infinite scrolling?"</em></p>
