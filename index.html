          <p>
            <a href="http://untranslatables.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Untranslatables</h3></a> is a web app that presents several "Untranslatable Words" in an entertaining, edifying and aesthetically pleasing way.

          <h3>The Context</h3>
          <p><em>Untranslatable Words,</em> are moods, needs and feelings that our own language has not yet properly pinned down. The perfect word – even if it comes from abroad – can help us to explain ourselves to other people – and its existence quietly reassures us (and everyone else) that a state of mind is not really rare, just rarely spoken of. The right word brings dignity to our troubles, and helps us identify more accurately what we really like or find annoying.</p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>The challenge was to create a design that would bring unity to - and make entertaining - a simple list of several disparate words from different countries with wildly differing meanings.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>The Process and Insight</h3>
        <p>One of our inspirations was a book called <span>Lost in Translation: An Illustrated Compendium of Untranslatable Words from Around the World</span> where the author illustrated each word. The book worked as a whole because it had a unified look and feel. We considered using stock photos, but with photos from different artists could not develop a coherent overall aesthetic.</p>
        <p>To create a simple and clean layout, where each word would have a center focus on the page, we created a card for each word, with a background image and a description besides the word itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Our solution was to present each word floating over a piece of fine art. The text had a standardized size and animation. Though diverse, the art helped create a unified overall aesthetic. The artwork also reinforced the meaning of each word by conveying something of the meaning of the word.</p>
        <p>We created a simple and slightly "addictive" content-focused website. To give some life to the web page, we used a pulsating CSS animation. Transform and transition effects on hover add playfulness to the reading experience and slow down the reader forcing a moment of contemplation.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p><em>"The CSS transformations are really calming"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Age-Otori was my favorite word"</em></p>

        <p><em>"I like the scrolling effect. Is this infinite scrolling?"</em></p>
