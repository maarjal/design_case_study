        <h3>2. The Context and Challenge</h3>
        <p><em><a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/untranslatable-words/">The Book of Life</em></a> explains Untranslatable Words as moods, needs and feelings that our own language has not yet properly pinned down. The perfect word – even if it comes from abroad – can help us to explain ourselves to other people – and its existence quietly reassures us (and everyone else) that a state of mind is not really rare, just rarely spoken of. The right word brings dignity to our troubles, and helps us identify more accurately what we really like or find annoying.</p>

        <p>The challenge is create subtle and simple design that would unify the words with many different origins and with different meanings.</p>

        <h3>3. The Process and Insight</h3>
        <p>Each word has a illustration in the book that describes the meaning of the word. We considered stock photos, but finding unified photos that would add to the overall design look was a challenge.</p>
        <p>We wanted to create a simple and clean layout, where each word would have a center focus on the page.</p>

        <h3>4. The Solution</h3>
        <p>Each untranslatable word is presented on a card of its own, which has a fine art background. The fine art background helps to create a unified style for untranslatable word from many different origins and meanings.</p>
